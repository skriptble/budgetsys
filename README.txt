The Budget System is a set of modules that together form a budget display system.
The initial release of the system will be catered toward the set up of the Student Association at SUNY Oswego's budgeting needs.

While this module is currently for a specific use case, I am aiming to extrapolate it into a budgeting application that can be used by any organization that has a model where users request funding from an approval body.

The main system is comprised of 3 modules:

Budget API - Provides an API for Budget Values, Line Items, and Organizations
Budget Line Items UI - Administrative UI for Line Items.
Budget Organizations UI - Administrative UI for Organizations
Budget Values UI - Administrative UI for Budget Values
The goal of this project is to make a Budgeting System that can handle taking a budget request for an organization/department & approving those expenses, submission of purchase orders, and creating analytics.

Currently the module can do the following:

Display Organization/Department budgets, specified by line item numbers.


This module may be used for production at this time, however, frequent updates will occur.
